   “Film as dream, film as music. No art passes our conscience in the way film does,
        and goes directly to our feelings, deep down into the dark rooms of our souls.” -Ingmar
        Bergman. The essence of movie-making is using film’s own visual language to create meaning
        and the highest achievement of the cinematic form is fusing film and viewer into one. If
        you are passionate about it and have a capable team, then step up, participate this
        wonderful event and show us your PASSION WITH REELS!!!
