        \n<b>KEY NAMES</b>\n\n
        1. PHARAOH(1): The Pharaoh(The King) is the most important piece for each side. If hit with a laser, it is destroyed and its owner loses the game.\n
        2. SCARAB(2): Scarabs consist primarily of dual-sided mirrors. They reflect a laser coming in from any direction, and thus cannot be eliminated from the board.\n
        3. ANUBIS(2): They have the advantage that, despite being unmirrored, they are not affected by a laser strike on the front, they must be hit on the sides to be eliminated.\n
        4. PYRAMID(7): Pyramids have a single diagonal mirror, and form the primary mechanism for directing the path of the laser. They are vulnerable to a hit from two of the four sides.\n
        5. SPHINX(1): Sphinxes hold the lasers. They can rotate in two directions only. A Sphinx is unaffected by laser fire, whether the opponent\'s or its own reflected back upon itself.\n
        \n
        <b>TARGET</b>\n\n
        The primary aim of a player is to illuminate the Pharaoh of the opponent without being illuminated by the self laser or of opponent\'s\n
        \n
        <b>DETAILS</b>\n\n
        1. PHARAOH: The Pharaoh is the most important piece for each side. If hit with a laser, it is destroyed and its owner loses the game. Similar to a king in chess, the Pharaoh pieces are comparatively weak, and so are often not moved unless under duress.\n
        2. SCARABS: Scarabs consist primarily of large, dual-sided mirrors. They reflect a laser coming in from any direction, and thus cannot be eliminated from the board. Also, unlike other pieces, Scarabs may move into an adjacent square even if it is already occupied, by switching places with the piece found there (whichever color it may be). Thus, they are the most powerful pieces on the board, but must be used with care, as a move that puts one side of the mirror in a favorable position may expose the player to attack using the opposite side of the same mirror.\n
        3. SPHINXES: In Khet 2.0, the Sphinxes hold the lasers. They may not move (each player\'s is located at their closest right-hand corner) but may be rotated in place so as to fire down the rank instead of the file. A Sphinx is unaffected by laser fire, whether the opponent\'s or its own reflected back upon itself.\n
        4. ANUBES: Anubis has the advantage that, despite still being un-mirrored, they are not affected by a laser strike on the front; they must be hit on the sides or rear in order to be eliminated.\n
        5. PYRAMIDS: Pyramids have a single diagonal mirror, and form the primary mechanism for directing the path of the laser. They are vulnerable to a hit from two of the four sides, and must be defended lest the player lose their ability to build paths of any size.\n
        \n
        <b>GENERAL RULES</b>\n\n
        1. Two players will play in one set at a time. (3 sets are available)\n
        2. In each turn a player will get a maximum of two minutes and for the next minute a negative point will be added. Maximum time limit is 3 minutes.\n
        3. If he/she does not make any move within the stipulated time, then and there he/she will be eliminated and opponent shall be declared as winner.\n
        4. A maximum of three warnings will be given for breaking any rule with a negative point.\n
        5. Negative points will be the measure for breaking tie-ups, if any.\n
        6. Mirrors of the pieces must not be touched.\n
        \n
        <b>ROUNDS</b>\n\n
        PRELIMS: With the CLASSIC model, the prelims will be held and based on prelims eight participants will be selected.\n
